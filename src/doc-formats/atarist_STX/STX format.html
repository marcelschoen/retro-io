      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp; <big>This
description is based mostly on Markus Fritze's article. He is floppy
expert and made some protections for Atari ST in past. I added couple
things to it + rearranged some parts . Made without format's author
contribution, this is certainly not complete. May contain some minor
errors, but intention is to help people who want to do something more
with thousands of STX images available - and not just playing under
emulators. <br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; First must to say some relevant things:&nbsp; Pasti STX
image format is not real floppy image. Of course, I talk about images
available around. Is there some non/published variant with more
details, more suitable for writing onto floppies - it is not on me to
talk about. I examined over 1000 STX images already. There is 2 major
type:
made with stock Atari ST machine and public avail. SW. Another is made
with Discovery Cartridge. Main difference between is way how track
image is made. 'Public' images contain track images as WD1772 floppy
controller reads them. Such images are good for emulators, but not
(really) for writing onto floppy. Plus, track image can not hold sector
data, and it must be stored separately, so such STX images are longer -
typical size is&nbsp; 2.1x&nbsp; of same format </big><big>unprotected
      </big><big> floppy image. With DC made images can hold sector
data inside track image, so size is usually 1.5x&nbsp; </big><big>of
same format </big><big>unprotected </big><big> floppy image.&nbsp;
More later.<br>
&nbsp; Other relevant informations regarding copy protections: there is
fuzzy bit mask, timing info for every sector, FDC status flag etc. All
it is mostly in form suitable for emulation, and not for floppy write.
No wonder - Pasti is made in cowork with Steem authors, and for sure
with heavy usage of Steem Debugger + Pasti Debugger in.<br>
&nbsp; What are chances for having floppy write option from Pasti
images one day ? How Pasti images can be used with HxC floppy emulator
?&nbsp; <br>
I'm not much optimistic about writing onto floppies. Even if it will be
made, it
will be limited. So, don't dream that you will be able to write any STX
onto floppy. I'm not say that it is entirely impossible. Just
conversion from current format to writeable one is very complicated.
Will someone do it ever ? With HxC it is&nbsp; better - some STX
images already are usable. Improving support for STX is currently under
work (Sept. 2011). But&nbsp; there is danger
of protections with delayed effect. It will let you play, but on some
later stage will crash machine or screw screen, or similar.&nbsp; So,
real testing may be time consuming. Track
read based protections are common, and HxC just started to emulate some
of them ...<br>
Update: HxC support is stopped at end of 2011. Someone just lost
motivation .<br>
      <br>
      <big><big>The format self:</big></big><br>
      <br>
      <big>File header (16 bytes)</big><br>
      <br>
0x00 : 'R','S','Y',0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - File ID<br>
0x04 : 0x0300.w &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Probably
the version number of the format<br>
0x06 : 0x0100.w&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; for public, &nbsp; or 0xCC00
for DC type<br>
0x08 : 0.w&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br>
0x0a : tracks.b &nbsp;&nbsp; (e.g. 80 or 160 for double sided)<br>
0x0b : 1.b &nbsp;&nbsp; *<br>
0x0c : 0.l&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br>
(w-word, 16 bits, &nbsp;&nbsp; b-byte,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; l-long, 32
bits.&nbsp; Little endian)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
I saw 3 STX file header types so far:<br>
      <br>
      <img alt="stxh1.png" src="STX%20format_files/stxh1.png" style="width: 382px; height: 36px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this is
by images made with public tool and stock Atari ST .<br>
      <br>
      <img alt="stxh2.png" src="STX%20format_files/stxh2.png" style="width: 380px; height: 36px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; images
made with DC .<br>
      <br>
      <img alt="stxh3.png" src="STX%20format_files/stxh3.png" style="width: 380px; height: 34px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
with DC too, I guess.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
After the file header one block for each track is following. Each block
also starts with a 16 byte header:<br>
      <big>Track Header (16 bytes):<br>
      <br>
      <small>0x00.l : length of the total track data in bytes. This
value plus the
current position in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file points to the
following track header.<br>
0x04.l :&nbsp;&nbsp; bytes of fuzzy sector mask in this track<br>
0x08.w : number of sectors in the track - but some may be only sector
address blocks, without sector data block - then loading time is 0 .<br>
0x0A.w : bitmask with flags<br>
0x0C.w : length of the track image in bytes (around 6kb is normal)<br>
0x0E.b :&nbsp; track number&nbsp; -&nbsp; it is:&nbsp; 0 - last track
on side
A (usually 0-79 or 81),&nbsp; and 128 -</small></big></big><big><big><small>
last track on side B (128-207/9) . So, side is determined by bit 7
(clever) .</small></big></big><br>
      <big><big><small>0x0F.b :&nbsp; Track image type flag:&nbsp; if 0
image is WDC track dump (public tool made). If 0xCC image is DC type .</small><br>
      </big></big>&nbsp; <br>
      <big><big>The bitmask for the flags (word at 0x0A in track header)</big><br>
      <br>
7 - The track image data also contains a sync-offset to the beginning
of the
first sync marker. It is word at track image data start .<br>
6 - If set, and track image type flag is 0 : the track is saved as an
image with all gaps via the read
track command. Sector contents are after track
data (public t.).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason is that WD1772 track read
command looses sync during track read, so sector data is not properly
read (more later).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If set, and track image type flag is
0xCC: the track is saved as image with DC device.&nbsp; Sector data is
usually embedded, but some may be after track image data.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all cases, sector data offsets must
be calculated from track image data beginning - more later.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If bit 6 clear, no track image data.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
5 - with PASTI 0.4b always set, if Bit 0 is set (= track protected)<br>
4 - unused<br>
3 - unused<br>
2 - unused<br>
1 - unused<br>
0 - If set the track is protected or with a non-standard sectorsize (!=
512 bytes). Well, it should be so. But in reality with public type
images it is always set. So, by unprotected tracks too. Likely because
there is always track image too.<br>
      <br>
Above description may little confuse.&nbsp; In practice, there are some
typical values:<br>
      <br>
      <big>0xC1</big>&nbsp; - Usually by made with DC -&nbsp; track is
not saved with
WD1772 read track command, but with DC - but not always. See track
image type flag for sure.. Typical track length is about 6KB.&nbsp;
Sector datas are inside track data. But some may be after .<br>
      <br>
      <big>0x61</big> : made with public tool. There is track image, as
WD1772 read track command readed it. There are all sector datas
too.&nbsp; It means that total track data is about 11KB. But in
practice, track image is needed only for couple tracks (protections) or
for none. So, there is overhead, caused by reason that images are made
usually by people not able to determine what tracks are protected.<br>
      </big><br>
      <big><big>0x21</big> :&nbsp; there are only sector datas. No
track dump. Usually by DC type. By public not - all tracks are usually
with flag 0x61 .<br>
      <br>
Empty&nbsp; tracks are with flag 0x21 and 0 sectors. Actually, then
there is only track header present.<br>
      <br>
If Bit 0 is clear, the track is unprotected and the number of sectors
as stored in the track block header are simply saved as 512 byte blocks
directly after the header. The track is therefore 16 + 512 *
sectors&nbsp; &nbsp;
bytes long.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rare case to see, even if most of tracks on
many floppies are actually unprotected.<br>
      <br>
If Bit 6 and 7 are clear, there is no track image and the sectors are
stored just by order end length - just like the fuzzy sector mask,
except this time for all sectors. Warning: sectors can be missing, if
only a header was read, but the data was missing. The FDC status has
Bit 4 (Record not found) set in this case.<br>
      <br>
If Bit 6 is set and 7 is clear, the track image is written with a track
image header and the sectors follow the track image in the usually
order and length. The track image header is just a word (little endian,
as usual) that contains the length of the track image.<br>
      <br>
Bit Bit 6 and 7 is set, the track image is written with a track image
header that has two words: the first one is a byte offset to the first
0xA1 address mark sync, the second word is the length of the track
image in bytes.&nbsp; Usually DC type, but not always.<br>
      <br>
If Bit 7 is set, the sector data is usually merged inside the track
image, the sector offsets then point inside the actual track image.
However, it is possible for single sectors to have an offset _behind_
the track image, if PASTI couldn't map them correctly into the track
image. A software should always read the sectors based on the sector
offset in the sector header.&nbsp; See track image type flag ....<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
If Bit 0 is set, the track header is first followed with the sector
headers. One for each sector in the track, again 16 bytes per header.<br>
      <big>Sector Header (16 bytes):<br>
      <br>
      <small>0x00.l : sector offset relative to&nbsp; last sector
header end ,&nbsp; or to end of fuzzy mask if exists.<br>
0x04.w : position of the sector header relative to the beginning of the
track as a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time stamp. The
position timing is depended on the RPM speed of the drive,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but for a ~6250 byte
track the value for a full rotation is around<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50000 (for 300 rpm).
This allows software to simulate the time it takes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to find the sector and
read it, something certain copy protection schemes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; test.<br>
0x06.w : read timing of the sector data, certain copy protections write
sectors so, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it takes longer to
read them. The protection measures the time to read the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sector. 16384 is the
default value, larger values mean that it takes longer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to read the sector
than normal. However if the measured value by PASTI is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; within 2% of this
value (16384 +/- 320), the value written to the stx file<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is 0 as a sign for a
stable read speed.<br>
      <br>
0x08.b : Track number from the address block identifying the sector
(typically 0..79)<br>
0x09.b : Side from the address block identifying the sector (typically
0 or 1)<br>
      <big>Note:</big>&nbsp; above 2 may be false, as part of the
protection (Gold of
the Aztecs + others) .<br>
      <br>
      <br>
0x0a.b : Sector from the address block identifying the sector
(typically 1..9 or 10, 11)<br>
0x0b.b : Size of the sector from the address block identifying the
sector<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (typically: 2=512 or
3=1024 bytes) - but may be more. Then only bits 0-1 matter.<br>
0x0c.b : First byte of the CRC over the address block<br>
0x0d.b : Second byte of the CRC over the address block<br>
0x0e.b : FDC status register after reading the sector<br>
0x0f.b : Sector flags, always 0x00<br>
      <br>
The CRC is a CCITT CRC16 calculated by the FDC. It is initialized with
0xFFFF and includes the sync marks, therefore typically
0xA1,0xA1,0xA1,0xFE plus the 4 bytes from the address block.</small><br>
      </big></big><br>
      <big>The FDC status is typically 0x00. Also common is 0x10 for a
sector not found and 0x08 for a CRC error when reading. Bit 7 has a
special meaning: it hints that the sector has fuzzy bits and the fuzzy
sector mask should be used. If Bit 7 is set, Bit 3 is usually also set,
because fuzzy bits will trigger a CRC error inside the sector.<br>
      <br>
After the sector headers the fuzzy sector mask is following, if the
value is != 0 in the track header. The mask identifies the bits that
are random in a given sector. The size of the fuzzy sector mask depends
on the sector size (from the header) and the number of fuzzy sectors in
the track itself. The fuzzy sector mask has bits set for every bit in
in the sector, that is _not_ random. Therefore a byte generated with
the mask could be calculated like this:<br>
      <br>
fdcSectorByte[byteOffset] = (sectorData[byteOffset] &amp;
fuzzyMask[byteOffset]) | (rand() &amp; ~fuzzyMask[byteOffset])<br>
      <br>
Following the fuzzy sector mask is the track data area . This area can
contain either the sectors by itself (when no track image), or the
complete track image with
the sectors embedded (DC type), or the complete track with the sectors
separate
(following the track image) (public type). How they are stored is
determined by Bits 6 and
7 in the track flags.<br>
      <br>
      </big><big>If
neither Bit 6 or 7 in the track flags is set,</big><big> after the
fuzzy sector mask, the sectors are written to the file.&nbsp; only the
content of the
sectors is written. Again with the sector size in the header taking
into consideration. These tracks can be also easily recognized by
sector offsets that are always a power of 2 (typically in 512 byte
increments), starting at 0.</big><br>
      <big> <br>
      <big>The track order:</big></big>&nbsp; <br>
      <big>Sometimes tracks are imaged in sidewise order:&nbsp; side A:
track 0, 1, 2 ... 79 , then side B: track 0, 1, 2 ... 79 . Sometimes
alternating: side A track 0, Side B track 0, side A track 1, side B
track 1, etc. I don't see special flag for it, but it is easy to get
order type by looking second track record - if there is 128 for track,
then it is alternating type. </big><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <big>A typical protected file looks like this:</big><br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; File Header<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; repeat ...<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <big><big>The track image:</big></big> <br>
      <big>It begins with track image header - 2 or 4 bytes depending
on bit 7 of track flag.&nbsp; (see above) . </big><br>
      <big>As said in beginning there is 2 type of track image.&nbsp;
WD 1772 floppy controller, used in Atari ST serie&nbsp; has track read
command. But it reads track content not exactly as may expect - the
point is that WD 1772 does resync during whole track read, so while
reading sector data too. It results in reading not exactly what is
written. More precise, the bit seq.&nbsp; %000101001 at any place in
track will init resync, what causes that following bits will be readen
not correctly. <br>
With DC made track images&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have no such problem, and I
guess that can be
used by floppy writing more-less direct. <br>
But do we really need track image for floppy write, and how it is used
by copy protections ?&nbsp; First to answer on second:&nbsp; generally,
by copy protections there is 2 way of track image usage:&nbsp; first,
more common is using track read and testing for some specific data
pattern, what differs from standard floppy format. For instance
Copylock from 1988 will seek 2 byte serial right before first sector
address block sync mark, on track 0. Normally, there are zeros.<br>
Second way is to use track image for data read. It allows lot of data -
up to 6KB/track, but needs some special measures, to avoid false
resync. By Maupiti Island all problematic sequences are prefixed with
byte 7, by International Soccer Challenge with byte 0x0F (the effect is
same). It avoids appearance of mentioned bit seq. so all bytes will be
readen correct, after first and only sync. Loader rutine then must
restoring correct data by removing prefixes and inserting correct
values .&nbsp; Writing such track with regular Atari (or PC) is not
possible . +&nbsp; 6KB/track is not possible anyway without special
equipment.<br>
Back to possibilities to write floppies basing on WD1772 track image
read: I guess that it is possible, at least by most. But needs proper
conversion, what may be not easy.<br>
      <br>
      </big><br>
      <br>
&nbsp;<big> <big>How Pasti works in practice ?&nbsp;</big> <br>
&nbsp; Works well with Steem emulator, and likely with Saint too. HxC
support is improved . And we have thousands&nbsp; of images avaialable
around.<br>
&nbsp;But there is a lot of STX images for not copy-protected&nbsp;
floppies.&nbsp; Because people can not judge what is really
protected,&nbsp;
and by some recommendations (do it with Pasti for sure) . Maybe the
plan was that some team will
verify Pasti images and make list which are really protected, which are
OK ?&nbsp;
Nothing from it is realised, for sure. Actually, author did nothing,
really and
literaly nothing in last 4 years. Or maybe 7 years, considering that
public imaging tool (v0.4b) is made in 2005. Still beta !&nbsp; In
meantime count of images groved,
and poeple want some details. I hope that this will at least partially
satisfy needs.<br>
I already did SW for converting STX to STT format (only with specific
protections, but already have about 60 working STT images, usable with
HxC and some even writeable onto floppies). SW for shrinking oversized
STX
files by dropping unnecessary track images (only for experts).&nbsp; <br>
Maybe this can help to add STX support for some other emulator
(Hatari)&nbsp; ?<br>
Technically, it seems as great achievement. As flaw I can count lack of
checksum for Pasti files. Actually, it would be best to have checksums
for all track datas separately. Considering not too reliable ways how
STX images are
transferred to PC:&nbsp; with transfer floppies, in multiple chunks, or
via some cable connection between ST and PC. Even hard disk transfer is
not 100 % safe.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;The best thing is that is
possible to make images of copy protected floppies with stock Atari ST
machines. And result of it is really lot of titles imaged. But looking
about how author self supports it (or better said, how supports it not)
I can only wish that someone other, with more sense for community and
communication would do it.<br>
      <br>

Notes:&nbsp; started by Alphabet, then choosing randomly few from STX
collection with over 1500 images - taken from GameBase ST, diverse WEB
sites (currently Atarimania is most active and has most) . Obviously
aprox. 90 % is made with public tool .<br>
      <br>
Why much more public type STX images ? For sure because most of people
have no Discovery Cartridge :-) .&nbsp; But this initiates some
thoughts about whole 'Pasti preservation project' :<br>
I'm pretty sure that at start ideas, plans were much bigger than it
outcame. Of course it is not the end, we may see new and new images yet
for years. But I doubt that number of DC type Pasti images will be very
big ever. And likely, only that type has real perspective to be
writeable (because of track image type) onto floppies or working with
HxC . So, the preservation is done (~70% of all Atari SW), but is it
real preservation ? I mean beeing limited on SW emulators only. I leave
it on reader to judge. What I can say is: 7-8 years after starting
creation of Pasti format and SW we still missing informations, relevant
and simple infos. Jorge Zwick is persona not talking much , at least
not talking about something he should, and he was asked many times by
many people. Pasti WEBpage contains very little information, not
updated for years. SW is in beta stage for 8 years ...&nbsp; Worst is
that beside lack of infos we have misleading informations: about
publishing specs, sources, plans about floppy write support etc. Excuse
of beeing busy just works not for me. Not giving any specs in 8 years ?
Come on ...&nbsp; There must be some other reason, and I guess that it
is related with lacking or 'fuzzy' replies to people in forums&nbsp; :-)</big>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <big><big><big>For the end, very important issue:&nbsp;
reliability of STX images<br>
      <small><small><br>
Are all Pasti images 100% OK ?&nbsp; What are chances that there are
errors in STX image ?<br>
Usually people test STX images before make them public available. Test
in Steem, of course. But how test ? I was not present at any of imaging
made by someone other, but can say with confidence that at least 99%
tests is made by checking&nbsp; only is game starts, until begin level,
or couple levels more.<br>
And here is possible <big>PROBLEM :&nbsp;<small>&nbsp; I start with
recent case: I imaged game Voyager with public Pasti. Floppy is 22
years old. Only with fourth floppy drive I got working STX image.
Running game directly&nbsp; from floppy confirmed that problem is not
Pasti -
with first drive game worked not on real Atari from original floppy. I
examined images, and found that error was exactly in copy protection.
It is Copylock, and sector 6 on track 0 was readen incorrect in first 3
imagings. It is slower reading sector with fake CRC error. But must be
readen 100 % correct - if not, game will not start. Pasti did not
notice error - normal, as there is CRC error reported by FDC. It just
confirms that CRC error is put there with purpose, to confuse copy SW.
This was straight case, and imaging error was obvious after short
testing.<br>
But we have a lot of <big>copy protections with delayed effect</big>.
or
performing check(s) in later game stage(s). It was btw.,
recommendetation of Rob Northen self too. So, it may happen that
protection check fails, but game still will work well until some later
stage. Or floppy read for protection check will happen on stage 11, for
instance.&nbsp; <br>
So, the only reasonable answer is:&nbsp; we can not be in all cases
sure that some Pasti image is 100% OK, because there are situations
when image may contain error(s), mostly caused by age of floppy disks
imaged, + by floppy drive, head align and similar.&nbsp; Pasti HW and
SW is not enough sofisticated to detect all possible errors during
imaging.<br>
      <small><big><big>So,&nbsp; playing games from STX image(s) until
end is required test - about image correctness</big></big>.&nbsp; <br>
      <big>It still not proves that every bit is readen correct, but is
good check
for correct imaging of crucial part: copy protection.<br>
Generally, copy protections are what makes floppy imaging very hard and
troublesome. And obviously, the place where most likely it may
fall.&nbsp; My opinion is that true preservation should include instead
images of copy ptotected public releases :&nbsp; the sources of
original, and executable SW in not copy protected form. But as things
are in real World - it will be not much of such ever. Many source is
lost
forever, authors, copyright holders care not for preservation. They
have no any copies, so for some SW only source is pirate crack. It is
big shame for all involved, and maybe just indicates that all what
interesting them is money. </big><br>
      <br>
      <big>And that above is not only some dark scenery, theory:&nbsp;
many of Atari ST floppies with game originals after 1989, 1990 have
some copy protection with delayed effect. It may be over 200 titles.
So, it is almost sure that some STX images are bad, considering that
imaging was made when disks were aprox. 18 years old in average.<br>
      <br>
      <big>Update:&nbsp; Expectable problems with Pasti images and what
we have online</big><br>
      <br>
As said, Pasti imaging is not flawless. Since author does nothing to
better inform people about it, not giving any clues about advanced
usage, I feel need to write here my experiences and recommendations to
make images with less possible errors.<br>
      <br>
If reading is unreliable some sectors may be readen bad. Then in normal
case SW reports CRC errors. Pasti usually warns not, just writes
readen, with CRC error flag on - assuming that it may be copy
protection. The
real bad thing is that quick checking of image will not show any
errors, because need to play more-less to reach problematic part. It
was case for instance with image of&nbsp; Kid Gloves posted at AF.<br>
Average user can hardly determine such problems - but examining STX
file may give some clue - if there are CRC errors in middle of disk,
over more sectors, it is likely not copy protection.<br>
      <br>
What average user can, and actually need to do is: taking care about
cleanliness of floppy drive. Floppies self is not recommended to clean,
but methode of multiple reading will for sure make it cleaner.<br>
      <br>
There are cases when imaging just don't work, and program stops. I will
not go much in that here - reasons may be some not supported
protection, or just very bad condition of disk. If cleaning helps not,
it is likely too damaged, and impossible to get correct image. Still,
it may be worth to keep such floppies. Some parts must be still OK -
may help in building image from multiple sources. This initiates
thoughts about how to coordinate hunt for missing rare titles ..<br>
      <br>
Another case, where image can fail is when copy protection is not
enough tolerant, and happens with some floppy drives used by imaging.
It is certainly rare case, but again, quick test of image may be noot
enough. So, it may happen that drive gives index pulse little earlier
or later than coders expected, and then copy protection check will
detect it as pirate copy. I saw such in case of games To Be On
Top&nbsp; and&nbsp; Rubicon. <br>
Btw. not enough tolerant code is not so rare case, and not only at copy
protections. For instance famous FastCopy Pro 3 had problems with
formatting floppies on several floppy drives - for me it never worked.
It was corrected in later revisions.<br>
      <br>
Fortunately, such 'bad' STX images (with little shifted track image)
can be used to get 'perfect' copy -
by running in Steem Debugger can see fine how copy protection check
fails, and correcting STX&nbsp; image by shifting little&nbsp;
problematic
track image.<br>

      <br>
      <br>
      <small><small> <br>
      </small></small></big></small></small></big></small></small></big></big>Delayed
protection problem is likely not only Pasti problem, but general
problem with
floppy images. </big><br>
      <big><br>
What is good in all this:&nbsp; in fact, testing of STX images is done
in many cases. Not in some organised form, but just by playing games
until end in emulators. Of course, mostly quality games were played.
People could report problems in diverse forums. Normally and especially
with Atari ST, you can not be always sure that the problem is bad STX
(image),
but after some time things getting clarified and some can finish game,
and say: it is good&nbsp; :-)</big><br>
